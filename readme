In SVI folder is the code we write. And SVI_0.1.0.tar.gz is we build in our own computer. Users can install through this 
document. In the future, we will release this through CRAN. The package we build calculates the approximate posterior in
two cases through the stochastic variational inference. In this version, for LDA setting, we require the user do data 
pre-processing themselves, that is, users need to remove the stop words by themselves. We may add this function in the future. 
We also will add some class functions soon. The usage can be seen in the documents.
